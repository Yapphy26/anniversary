# 💖 Couple Anniversary Website  

A special website I built for my girlfriend for our **1st anniversary** 💕.  
It’s a simple interactive **music player** with custom UI and features.

## 📖 Description  
This project is a personal gift — an interactive website designed to celebrate our anniversary.  
The site includes a custom music player with volume control and a responsive layout.

## ⚠️ Important Notes  
I’m hosting this project on **GitHub Pages**, and I also created a **QR code** that points to this static site link.  
Since the QR code is fixed and cannot be changed, I won’t be adding new features or modifying the repo anymore.  

This repo will always stay online so the QR code link will continue to work in the future. ❤️
